## Exercise 1

Declare 2 variables, a and b, and assign 20 to a and 4 to b
Declare a variable add that uses the + operator to store the result of adding the values stored in a and b
Declare a variable minus that uses the - operator to store the result of subtracting the values stored in a and b
Declare a variable multiply that uses the * operator to store the result of multiplying the values stored in a and b
Declare a variable dividing that uses the / operator to store the result of dividing the values stored in a and b
You can print the value of the variables to the browser console (ex: console.log(add)) to check the result.

## Exercise 2

Use the following code to answer the questions below:
let a = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Jackie";
let lastName = "Chan";

What is the value of: a + str?
What is the value of: a + str2?
What is the value of: a + isPresent?
What is the value of: a + firstName?
What is the value of: a + lastName?
Use the code above to test and print the results.

## Exercise 3

Use the following code to answer the questions below:
let d = 5;
let str3 = "5";
let str4 = "five";
let isPresent2 = false;
let firstName2 = "Robin";
let lastName2 = "Williams";

What is the value of: d == str3?
What is the value of: d === str3?
What is the value of: !isPresent2?
What is the value of: (“eleven” == str4 && d >= str3)?
What is the value of: (!isPresent2 || isPresent2)?
What is the value of: 0 == false?
What is the value of: 0 === false?
What is the value of: 0 != false?
What is the value of 0 !== false?
Use the code above to test and print the results.

## Exercise 1
Initialize an integer to represent a favorite number and assign a value with a number of your choosing or you can assign a random number to this variable.

Use window.prompt() to ask the user to input a number, and store the result in a variable

Create an if-statement that if the guessed number is below the initial value, print out “too low”.

Create an else-if statement that if the number is higher than the initial value, print out “too high”.

Create an else statement that prints out “Congratulations!!!”.

## Exercise 2
Declare a variable named userInput2 (or whatever topic you’ll ask about) and set the value to window.prompt(“Whatever question you want to ask here”).

Inside of the parentheses, ask a question on whatever (appropriate) topic you’d like.

Create a switch-case statement with 5+ cases and a default case.
Log a response to the console depending on the value of userInput2.
